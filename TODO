PROJECT NOTES
- Code is in the 'scrape' branch. Push to that branch only

TODO
- Create local MongoDB (~DONE) (1)
- Add queue which adds papers from authors list.
- There likely will be papers which we are unable to work with. It'd be wise to keep a list of such files.
- Delete temp files which have been downloaded.

IDEAS
- Add references to database
- Maybe the following tool would be better for citations. https://pythonhosted.org/refextract/

EXTENSIONS
Consider supporting papers which don't have .bib files.


(1) Done on Austin's local machine.
(2) currently we just go through all the .tex files within the source.
