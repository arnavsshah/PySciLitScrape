- Create local MongoDB
- use TextSoup to scrape sections and text from latex source
    - first download as a tar.gz file
    - extract
    - search for main.tex (if not there, ignore this paper, try a new one)
    - look at all sections and corresponding .tex files
    - scrape any relevant text and store in the original dictionary
