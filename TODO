PROJECT NOTES
- Code is in the 'scrape' branch. Push to that branch only

TODO
- Create local MongoDB (~DONE) (1)
- use TextSoup to scrape sections and text from latex source
    - first download as a tar.gz file (DONE)
    - extract (DONE)
    - search for main.tex (if not there, ignore this paper, try a new one) (2)
    - look at all sections and corresponding .tex files (DONE)
    - scrape any relevant text and store in the original dictionary
- Add queue which adds papers from authors list.
- There likely will be papers which we are unable to work with. It'd be wise to keep a list of such files.
- Delete temp files which have been downloaded.

IDEAS
- Add references to database


(1) Done on Austin's local machine.
(2) currently we just go through all the .tex files within the source.
