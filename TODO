PROJECT NOTES
- Code is in the 'scrape' branch. Push to that branch only

TODO
- There likely will be papers which we are unable to work with. It'd be wise to keep a list of such files.
- Have checkpoints after each author (perhaps save the queue)

IDEAS
- Maybe the following tool would be better for citations. https://pythonhosted.org/refextract/

EXTENSIONS
- Consider supporting papers which don't have .bib files.


(1) Done on Austin's local machine.
(2) currently we just go through all the .tex files within the source.
